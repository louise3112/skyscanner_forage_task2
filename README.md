# Skyscanner Forage - Task 2
Gained experience of implementing a mircorservice to manage search results in Java using the Dropwizard framework and testing with Postman as part of Skyscanner's Software Engineering Virtual Experience Programme on Forage.


## To Run
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (created in 2022.2.1).  
Hit 'Run' (green triangle in top right corner) to run the microservice.  
Postman can then be used to test example POST requests to check associated output is correct.
